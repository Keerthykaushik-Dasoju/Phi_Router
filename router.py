# üëâ Reward values range from 1 to 10:
# - A **reward of 1** means the response is highly accurate, complete, and well-aligned with human expectations.
# - A **reward of 10** means the response is very poor, incorrect, or irrelevant.
# - Values in between indicate varying degrees of quality, coherence, or alignment.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Your job is NOT to choose the model with the highest reward.

# ‚úÖ Instead, follow these steps strictly:
# 1. **Match the context**: Among the past examples, first identify the one where the **query is most similar** to the new target query (e.g., similar mathematical structure, reasoning type, or subject).
# 2. **Match the reward**: From that specific matched examples, select the model whose **reward is numerically closest (less absolute difference)** to the target reward.

# üìå üìå Important note:
# Do NOT assume lower reward = better.

# Instead, calculate the absolute difference between the target reward and each model‚Äôs reward, like this:

# ‚Üí |Target - Model A reward| = difference A  
# ‚Üí |Target - Model B reward| = difference B

# Then choose the model with the **smaller numerical difference**.

# üß† Example:
# If Model A's reward = 1  
# Model B's reward = 5  
# Target reward = 4  
# Then:

# |4 - 1| = 3  
# |4 - 5| = 1

# So you must choose Model B, because 1 < 3.

# - The selected model name
# - Absolute reward differences with both models (show which model as well)

First, the energy release rate of the mold film is controlled successfully for an efficient transfer process, which was confirmed by contact angle measurements compared to the normal PUA. The transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS layer exhibits comparable smoothness, and also induces the favorable crystallinity of perovskite related to the spin-coated layer, which shows similar JSC and PCE (spin-coated compared to transfer printing: 12.85% compared to 12.33%), and improved VOC. The effects of the device electrical parameters are analyzed in detail by PL mapping, charge carrier mobility, and impedance response. Furthermore, the stability of the device with transfer-printed PEDOT:PSS achieved 90% retention for approximately 40\u202fdays, which was affected by the preserved crystallinity of perovskite, and the inhibition of the degradation of ITO from XRD and XPS analyses, respectively. Consequently, the transfer-printed hole extraction layer through the interface control between PUA and PEDOT:PSS using the improved hydrophobicity contributes to maintaining the surface morphologies and device electrical properties; this correlates with the stable operation of perovskite photovoltaics.']'

Unfortunately, it has been challenging to achieve high-quality films over large areas using scalable methods under realistic ambient conditions. Herein, we investigated the coupling between the fluid dynamics and the structural evolution during controlled film formation for ambient scalable fabrication of CsPbI2Br perovskite films using blade coating. We simultaneously overcame the negative influences of moisture attack and the B√©nard-Marangoni instability in the drying ink and achieved an ideal sequential crystallization with changing halide composition during the film formation. As a result, we produced highly crystalline, uniform, and pinhole-free CsPbI2Br films with superior photophysical and transport properties. High-performance solar cells are fabricated to achieve power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 14.7% for small-aperture-area (0.03\xa0cm2) devices and 12.5% for the large-aperture-area (1.0\xa0cm2) ones, the highest PCE reported to date for large-area all-inorganic perovskite solar cells.']'

However, the defects and grain boundaries in perovskite films dramatically degrade their performance. Here, we show a two-step annealing method to produce mesoporous PbI2 films for growth of continuous, pinhole-free perovskite films with large grains, followed by additional ethanol vapor annealing of perovskite films to reduce the defects and grain boundaries. The large perovskite grains dramatically suppress the carrier recombination, and consequently we obtain ZnO-nanorod-based PSCs that exhibit the best efficiency of 17.3%, with high reproducibility.']'
